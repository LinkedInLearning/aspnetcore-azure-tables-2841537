After an app is developed and made available to users, making drastic database changes is an almost impossible task unless your data storage is nonrelational. Using nonrelational storage such as Azure Table storage makes it easy to change the database structure if you need toâ€” without breaking the app. In this course, instructor Ervis Trupja helps you get up to speed with Azure Table storage, explaining how to work with it in an ASP.NET Core application using the Cosmos DB Table API. Ervis goes over the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as what Azure Table storage has to offer. He steps through how to set up Azure Table storage in an ASP.NET Core application. He also explores how to add, update, read, and delete data from tables in Azure Table storage. To wrap up, Ervis covers how to replicate Azure Table storage data globally, allowing users around the world to access your data without experiencing latency.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in GitHub to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
